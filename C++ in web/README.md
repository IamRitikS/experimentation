# C++ in Web
This directory contains a rough project that emphises on using C++ as web backend and front end language.

## Used Technologies

List of technologies that I have used for this project
#### HTML+CSS
  HTML and CSS only to design basic front end page. Although all pages are displayed using CGI script.

#### C++
  C++ has always been my favorite and go-to language for coding and problem solving challenges, but I had never used it on web. For that, I primarily focused on Node.js and Php. I had only heard that it was possible to use C++ on web. So I decided gave it a try and turn this mythical story into truth.
 
#### JS Canvas
  Used JS Canvas to do few animations on welcome screen.
  
#### libmysqlcppconn.so
  It is MySQL connector library for C++. Without it, connecting C++ code to database seemed impossible.

#### AWS
  Project's working code is hosted on AWS. Seemed like the best free solution that supported C++ as CGI. Visit http://3.6.206.13/
